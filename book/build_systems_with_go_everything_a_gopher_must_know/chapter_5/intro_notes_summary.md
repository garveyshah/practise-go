# CHAPTER 5

# REFLECTION

In programming, reflection is the ability of a program to examine, introspect and modify its structure and behavior. 
This is a form of metaprogramming.
Reflection is an extremely powerful tool for developers and extends the horizon of any programming language.

In this Chapter, we introduce the `reflect` package and explain through examples how to to explore, introspect and modify our code in run-time.
The explantion is split into two sections:
- According to how Go organizes the reflection package
- How Go uses tags to enhance fields information.
